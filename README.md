# Snake-Game-with-python
With older Nokia phones, we had an old-age addiction with the snake game. But of course, we don‚Äôt have it anymore. What if you could write one for yourself using Python? Beginner Python programmers who are interested in making something easier in their domain can definitely try this out, and the module Turtle was built specifically for beginners to try and submit as part of the project. The project will be done in Python 3.

As a result, we will create a Python-based game using the following modules:

Turtle: It‚Äôs a pre-installed Python library that lets users create shapes and pictures using a virtual canvas.
Time: Use this function to count how many seconds have passed since the epoch.
Random: This function generates random numbers in Python by using the random module.

üêç New Features Added:
Game Levels: The game gets faster as you score more points.
Boundaries Toggle: Option to enable/disable wall collisions.
Power-Ups: Randomly appearing power-ups that grant special abilities (e.g., temporary speed boost, slow down, or extra points).
Pause/Resume Feature: Pause and resume the game with the spacebar.
Scoreboard: Display the top 5 scores.
